		<h1>Interesting Facts About Mario</p>
		
		<h2>Mario is on shrooms?</h2>
		<p> Mario is often depicted eating mushrooms, smoking flowers, while turtles and living bullets try to kill him, so I would say he is tripping pretty hard. The ability to shrink and grow because of the mushroom is a reference to Alice and Wonderland said Miyamoto in a 2005 interview.  As Alice in Wonderland is often read as an allegory for drug use, it that the Mario series i also inspired by hallucinatory drugs.</p><br>
		
		<h2>Super Mario Movie</h2>
		<p>Everyone knows that this movie was a major bust.  Even Miyamoto said that the movie was bad, but because it was too similar to the game.  But did you know that Super Mario Bros was the first video game franchise based movie?  Based on how the movie did, it is not surprising that this was the first time this had ever been done.</p><br>
