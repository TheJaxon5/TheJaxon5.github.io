		<h1>Interesting Facts About Mario</p>
		
		<h2>Mario is on shrooms?</h2>
		<p> Mario is often depicted eating mushrooms, smoking flowers, while turtles and living bullets try to kill him, so I would say he is tripping pretty hard. The ability to shrink and grow because of the mushroom is a reference to Alice and Wonderland said Miyamoto in a 2005 interview.  As Alice in Wonderland is often read as an allegory for drug use, it that the Mario series is also inspired by hallucinatory drugs.</p><br>
		
		<h2>Super Mario Movie</h2>
		<p>Everyone knows that this movie was a major bust.  Even Miyamoto said that the movie was bad, but because it was too similar to the game.  But did you know that Super Mario Bros was the first video game franchise based movie?  Based on how the movie did, it is not surprising that this was the first time this had ever been done.</p><br>

		<h2>Mario Conspiracy Theories</h2>
		<p>There have been many interesting and completely plausible theories crated over the years about the ever expanding Mario universe.  Most of these are created because Nintendo has been very vague about lore, leaving the people of the internet to let their brains go wild.  One awesome place for these theories is a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w">The Game Theorist</a>.  He breaks down internet video game theories, and explains the truth behind them, and has on many occasions convinced me. </p>
