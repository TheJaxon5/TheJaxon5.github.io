		<h2>Mario is on shrooms?</h2>
		<p> Mario is often depicted eating mushrooms, smoking flowers, while turtles and living bullets try to kill him, so I would say he is tripping pretty hard. The ability to shrink and grow because of the mushroom is a reference to Alice and Wonderland said Miyamoto in a 2005 interview.  As Alice in Wonderland is often read as an allegory for drug use, it that the Mario series i also inspired by hallucinatory drugs.</p><br>
